# viewsonanobject

_Views on an object_

A book generator that takes files from the NTU 3D model database, manipulating them by processes of slicing, segmentation, and rotation-- as well as examination of metadata. Eventually, the program operates directly on the .obj files that form the logic of the models, shuffling vertices and faces to create perturbed objects that contain a ghost of their origin, while becoming something entirely new.
